"""Extractor port — turns a file into one or more text chunks.

A single ``ExtractorPort`` Protocol covers every modality (csv, pdf, docx, audio,
video, image). The Preprocessor maps file extensions to concrete extractor
instances at composition time, so adding a new format = new adapter + new entry
in the map, no changes to the orchestrator.
